# Movies-App
This is a React web application. 
- This web application is build using HTML, Tailwind Css, Vite + React. 
- I have used react-router-dom to create routes for different pages.  
- This web application is well optimized for different sizes of sceens. 
- I have used environment variable to hide the bearer token in the code. 
- I have added a loading Screen in the **Details** page. So, while API call isn't finished a loading screen will be shown to the user.
- Infinite scroll is implemented in two pages.
